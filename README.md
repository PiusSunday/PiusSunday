# Hi there, I'm Pius Sunday Ojwo - aka Sunny 👋

## About Me 👨🏽‍💻

👨‍🎓 I am pursuing a Master of Science in Software Engineering and have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis on networks.

💻 I'm also a Google IT Support certificate holder and a cross-platform developer with expertise in mobile development and data science.

🚀 I have a passion for contributing to open-source projects, and I'm always excited to learn new technologies. In the past, I've learned Java basics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently exploring Flutter and Dart, Python for data science, and APIs.

🌟 Recently, I completed a summer internship with Easy-Relay, where I worked on mobile application development using Flutter and Dart with Agile-Scrum methodologies. Additionally, I completed a bachelor's thesis project on a mobile price prediction application that uses machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.

🎤 I've also been actively involved in public speaking, delivering various conference talks and workshops on Flutter and Dart. I've conducted insightful and practical workshops for audiences ranging from 50 to 1000 people on various tech-related topics.

👨‍💼 I'm currently the President of the Google Developer Groups Constantine Chapter (GDG), where my team and I are responsible for organizing impactful events and conferences, networking with potential event partners, speakers, mentors, and organizers, and growing and impacting the lives of every member in the chapter on a wide range of technical topics and activities.

💪 In my personal time, I enjoy developing new skills and hobbies, including singing, playing football, and working out regularly to stay healthy and focused. I also love traveling and exploring new places, although it's been a while since I've had the chance to do so.

👨‍💻 I have experience developing various projects, including home 🏠, bitcoin 💰 ticker, and climate 🌡️ weather apps, among others, using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. I've also created a laptop 💻 price prediction API using Python and Flask and deployed it to Heroku, as well as a chat 💬 app using Flutter and Dart.

🚀 In summary, I'm a dedicated, driven, and enthusiastic software engineer with a passion for learning and growing in my field. 🌟
